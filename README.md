# Illicit-financial-flows
Do-files for chapters contributed (with Alex Cobham) to the Report of the High Level Panel on IFF chaired by Thabo Mbeki (UNECA/AU).

This repository contains the master do-file used to generate the analysis and results included in the chapters of the report "Track it! Stop it! Get it! Report of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial
Flows from Africa" by the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows chaired by Thabo Mbeki. This report was commissioned by the African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa.

I presented this research to the Technical Committee of the High Level Panel in Addis Ababa in November 2013.

The report was subsequently adopted as a declaration at the 24th African Union summit of Heads of States in January 2015.

This repository also includes a Mata programme to automatically generate graphs.
